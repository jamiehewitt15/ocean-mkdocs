The documentation about writing and maintaining the Ocean Protocol documentation.

## Introduction

In Ocean Protocol, each asset gets its own ERC721 **data NFT** and one(or more) ERC20 **datatokens**. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by directly leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and more.

OCEAN token is used for staking, and more. [Here](https://oceanprotocol.com/token) are details.

Ocean Protocol provides tools for developers to _build data markets_, and to _manage data NFTs and datatokens_ for use in DeFi.

## Build Data Markets
Use Ocean Protocol software tools to build your own data marketplace, by either forking [Ocean Market](https://v4.market.oceanprotocol.com/) code or building up with Ocean components.

## Manage datatokens and data NFTs for use in DeFi

Use Ocean [JavaScript](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js) or [Python](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py) drivers to manage data NFTs and datatokens:

- _Publish and access data services:_ downloadable files or compute-to-data. Use Ocean to deploy a new [ERC721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-721.md) and [ERC20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/7f4f0377730f5fc266824084188cc17cf246932e/EIPS/eip-20.md) datatoken contract for each data service, then mint datatokens.

- _Transfer datatokens_ to another owner (or approve & transferFrom).

- _Manage pools._ Deploy OCEAN-datatoken [Balancer](https://www.balancer.fi/) pools, buy & sell datatokens (swap), and add & remove liquidity.

- _And more._ Use ERC20 support in [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/), [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html#working-with-an-erc20-token-contract) and Solidity to connect datatokens with crypto wallets and other DeFi services.

## Compute-to-Data
Ocean's "Compute-to-Data" feature gives compute access to privately-held data, which never leaves the data owner‚Äôs premises. Ocean-based marketplaces enable the monetization of private data while preserving privacy. [Here](/tutorials/compute-to-data-architecture/) are details.
